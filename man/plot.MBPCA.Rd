\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class \code{MBPCA}.}

\item{axes}{A vector of length two which specifies the global components to plot (by default the first two).}

\item{graphtype}{Type of graph to plot. Either "globalscores", "blockscores","globalcor","blockcor", "expl", "cumexpl", "crit" or "contrib".
Refer to the details section.}

\item{select}{Selection of elements to plot (by default, select=NULL). Refer to the details section.}

\item{max.overlaps}{Exclude text labels that overlap too many things (by default, 20).}

\item{xlim}{Range for the plotted 'x' values.}

\item{ylim}{Range for the plotted 'y' values.}

\item{title}{Title of the graph to draw.}

\item{color}{Color for the plot.}

\item{...}{Further arguments.}

\value{
Returns graphs showing the projection of individuals in both global and block components, the correlations of variables with the global and block components,
the percentages of inertia explained by the global components and their cumulative values, the values of the maximization criterion and the contributions of the blocks
to the determination of global components.
}
\description{
Plot the main graphs for MB-PCA.
}
\details{
The arguments graphtype and select are used as follow.\cr
If graphtype="globalscores", individuals are projected on the space formed by the global components.\cr
In this case, if for example, select=NULL, all the individuals are plotted. However, if select=5, only the first five individuals are plotted.\cr
If graphtype="blockscores", individuals are projected on the space formed by the block components.\cr
If select=NULL, individuals of each block are plotted on separate figures.\cr
If select=c(1,3), individuals of blocks 1 and 3 are plotted on separate figures.\cr
If graphtype="globalcor", correlations of original variables with the global components are depicted.\cr
If select=NULL, correlations of the variables of all the blocks are plotted on the same figure.\cr
If select=c(1,3), correlations of the variables of blocks 1 and 3 are plotted.\cr
If graphtype="blockcor", correlations of original variables with the block components are depicted.\cr
If select=NULL, correlations of the variables of each block are plotted on seperate figures.\cr
If select=c(1,3), correlations of the variables of blocks 1 and 3 are plotted.\cr
If graphtype="expl", percentages of inertia of all the blocks explained by the global components are drawn.\cr
If graphtype="cumexpl", cumulative percentages of inertia of all the blocks explained by the global components are drawn.\cr
graphtype="crit" plots the values of the maximization criterion.\cr
graphtype="contrib" depicts the contribution of each block of variables to the determination of the global components.\cr
For graphtype="expl", "cumexpl", "crit" and "contrib", if select=NULL, all the dimensions are plotted. \cr
But if for example, select=5, only the first five dimensions are plotted.\cr
